        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>I have taken part in several hackathon events where I worked with a team to come up with and build creative tech solutions in a short amount of time. I also worked on a project in ECE called "Smart Alert and Monitoring System", which was made to improve safety and keep track of data in real time using sensors. These experiences helped me learn how to use technology in practical ways and work well with others, even in challenging situations.</p>
